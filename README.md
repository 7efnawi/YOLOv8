# üåü Aura Sense: Advanced Object Detection with YOLOv8

![YOLOv8 Demo](https://ultralytics.com/images/yolov8-sahi-demo.png)

## üîç Project Overview

Aura Sense is an innovative graduation project that implements state-of-the-art object detection using YOLOv8. The system provides real-time, accurate detection of objects in images through an intuitive web interface and API.

## ‚ö° YOLOv8 Model

YOLOv8 represents the cutting edge in object detection technology, offering remarkable improvements over previous generations:

### üèÜ Performance Metrics

| Model   | Size   | mAP<sup>val<br>50-95 | Speed<br>(ms) | Parameters<br>(M) |
| ------- | ------ | -------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| YOLOv8x | 131 MB | 53.9                 | 23.4          | 68.2              |

### üéØ Key Features

- **State-of-the-art accuracy**: Achieves over 53.9% mAP on COCO dataset
- **Real-time processing**: Detects objects in milliseconds
- **Multi-object detection**: Identifies and localizes multiple object classes simultaneously
- **High confidence scoring**: Provides probability scores for all detections
- **Pre-trained on diverse datasets**: Recognizes 80+ common object categories

## üì• Getting the YOLOv8 Model File

To run this project, you need the YOLOv8x model file. Due to its large size (131 MB), it is not included in this repository. You can obtain it using one of these methods:

### Option 1: Download from Google Drive

1. Download the model file from: [YOLOv8x.pt on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X9iry83QaPsbkJN3wFi20vu0AO2cvish/view?usp=drive_link)
2. Place the downloaded file in the project root directory

### Option 2: Download using the Ultralytics package

```bash
# Install the ultralytics package
pip install ultralytics

# Download the YOLOv8x model
from ultralytics import YOLO
YOLO("yolov8x.pt")  # This will download the model if it doesn't exist
```

## üöÄ Implementation

Our implementation offers:

- **Web-based UI**: Simple drag-and-drop interface for image uploads
- **Visual results**: Processed images with bounding boxes and labels
- **Confidence metrics**: Detailed probability scores for all detections
- **Result storage**: Automatic saving of detection results for reference

## üîß API Documentation

The API provides a simple interface for object detection services:

### Endpoints

#### `POST /detect`

Upload an image for object detection.

**Request:**

- Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`
- Body: form data with `file` field containing the image

**Response:**

```json
{
  "detections": [
    {
      "class": "person",
      "confidence": 0.96,
      "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2]
    },
    {
      "class": "car",
      "confidence": 0.87,
      "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2]
    }
  ],
  "image_url": "/result/exp1/detection.jpg",
  "processing_time": "0.245s"
}
```

## üíª Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/aura-sense.git
   cd aura-sense
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the YOLOv8x model as described in the "Getting the YOLOv8 Model File" section

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5000`

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Flask
- Ultralytics YOLOv8

## üìù Note

This repository does not include:

- `templates/` folder containing UI templates
- `uploads/` folder for temporary image storage
- Large model files (\*.pt)

These files need to be downloaded or created separately.
